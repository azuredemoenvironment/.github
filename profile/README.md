The **Azure Demo Environment (ADE)**, is an end-to-end solution and reference
architecture that is deployed into your Azure subscription. It is designed to
help you quickly get started with Azure, show how Azure services can integrate
in a real-world scenario, and provide code samples that you can use to reference
and build your own solutions.

While not every Azure service is deployed as a part of ADE, it does showcase
many of the common, and more often complex, scenarios within Azure. Governance,
networking, security, and monitoring are all important parts of ADE, following
Azure best practices across the entire solution.
