# Azure Demo Environment

The Azure Demo Environment (ADE), is a series of PowerShell scripts, CLI script,
and Bicep ARM templates that automatically generates an end-to-end environment
of Azure resources and services to your Azure Subscription.

While not every Azure service is deployed as a part of ADE, it does showcase
many of the common, and more often complex, scenarios within Azure, and it can
be used as a reference architecture when designing a solution.

The Azure Demo Environment is built to be deployed, deallocated, allocated,
removed, and re-deployed. The deployment and removal processes takes
approximately two hours for the entire solution.

The Azure Demo Environment is an Open Source Project.
